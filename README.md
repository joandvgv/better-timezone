# Better Timezone [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/clara-labs/better-timezone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clara-labs/better-timezone)
### A jQuery plugin for making sane timezone selects.

![What it looks like](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/546651/6496717/c345636e-c28b-11e4-9ac9-1ae6a23f6a68.png)

This jQuery plugin creates a simple, configurable dropdown and autocomplete element. For some reason, this hasn't really been solved yet. Timezones are pretty weird and vary year to year, so we've compiled and cross-checked several different data sources:

* IANA timezone database
* Microsoft timezone database
* Unicode Common Locale Data Repository

## Dependencies

* jQuery
* Select2

## Plugin Size

~20kb total

## Usage

1. Include jQuery and Select2:

  ```html
  <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/4.0.0-rc.1/css/select2.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/4.0.0-rc.1/js/select2.full.min.js"></script>
  ```

2. Include plugin's code:

  ```html
  <script src="dist/better-timezone.min.js"></script>
  ```

3. Include your target element:
  ```html
  <select id="element">
    <option value="" disabled selected>Please select a timezone</option>
  </script>
  ```

3. Call the plugin:

  ```javascript
  $("#element").betterTimezone({
    showIANA: false,
    showOptgroups: false
  });
  ```

## Options

### showIANA

*Boolean*: make better-timezone include all IANA classification geolocations.

### showOptgroups

![optgroups and IANA](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/546651/6496719/c35b203c-c28b-11e4-98a1-69bd939b4309.png)
